		<h3>GameCubePC</h3>
		<p style = "inherit">The GameCube has become a timeless console, however the technology within has not aged as well. Based on a project done by Youtube Channel Tech by Matt, the purpose of this project was to create a portable gaming machine while still maintaining the pleasurable aesthetics of the GameCube. The original project began to meet these requirements, however it lacked actual use of the handle associated with the game. Using the parts from a barebones pc sold by Asrock, the A300 DeskMini, along with a Dremel, soldering iron and a 3d printer, I created a working desktop pc hiding in the shell of a GameCube. </p>

		<h3 style = "inherit">3D Printed Phone Case</h3>
		<p style = "inherit" >While phone cases are very cheap and readily available, they lack creativity that I love to have in my projects. That's why I turned my phone case into one of those projects. To create this case, I traced an image taken from the animated music video, "The Wolf" by Siam√©s, then developed three separate models that could be overlapped in CURA, my 3D printing slicer of choice. This case is made of blue TPU, black PLA, and glow in the dark PLA. The next version will add white PLA into the case and dedicate two layers of PLA to making the design.

		<h3 style = "inherit">3D Printed Wooden Violin </h3>
		<p style = "inherit">During the most isolating parts of the pandemic, I decided I would begin to learn a second instrument. The choice I made was the violin. However, the price of a new violin kit was about 120 dollars. At the same time, I learned about the <a href = "https://www.hovalabs.com/hovalin" target="_blank">Hovalin, a 3D printable violin</a>, and wood filament, a mixture of wood fibers and PLA that creates a printable material that sets much like real wood, with a lot of the same properties. After adjusting the model for the expansion of the filament and 3 days of printing, the violin was complete. Tuners, strings, and a bow were purchased for this project.</p>
