		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p> Even before graduating highschool, I took advantage of the 
		large amount of time I had and started college early, attending Nashua Community
		College. After spending a year of studying, I was accepted to Wentworth 
		Institute of Technology, into their Electromechanical Engineering program. At the time
		of being accepted, the major was a five year program, which I had decided to finish within 
		four years. 
			
			During my highschool at Alverin in Hudson NH, I also attended Nashua Communinity College and earned additional college credits by taking advantage of the extra time and the high school credits that I had already earned from my prior STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) school at Academy of Science and Design in Nashua, NH. 

I then applied for the five year Electromechanical Engineering program and was accepted into Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT). While persuing the bachelores degree at WIT, I continously accelerated my learning and now targeting to complete my double bacholers in Mechanical and Electrical engineering within four years.

I will be completing my majors in Electrical and Mechnical engineering, with minors in Math and Manufacturing. I have always been about learning more and increasing my knowledge as an allrounders in my hobies and studies.
